# Employee-Pay-Program
This program calculates the salaries of employees in a small company.  Information for each employee is received from a text file called "input.txt".  

Each record of each employee is saved into a Class called PERSON which is stored in a file called "person.h". The file person.cpp contains proper definitions for all function declarations in the header file.  Then, the person.cpp file was made to contain proper definitions for all function declarations in the header file.        

Lastly, the pay.cpp file contains the main function.  The other funcions in this file are readData and writeData.  The program retrieves data from the input file then outputs data into an output file ("output.txt").  The data in the output file is the result of combining each employee's fullname and total pay."
